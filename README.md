Sentiment Analysis on Amazon reviews dataset
Amazon Reviews Project

Use one of the following datasets to perform sentiment analysis (using
Naïve Bayes and KNN, with Bag of Words, tf-idf) on the given Amazon
reviews. Pick one of the &quot;small&quot; datasets that is a reasonable size for
your computer. The goal is to create a model to algorithmically predict
if a review is positive or negative just based on its text. Try to see how
these reviews compare across categories. Does a review
classification model for one category work for another?
Iterate by engineering new features, removing poor features, or tuning
parameters. Repeat this process until you have five different versions
of your classifier. Once you&#39;ve iterated, answer these questions to
compare the performance of each:
o Do any of your classifiers seem to overfit?
o Which seem to perform the best? Why (explain algorithmically
over the dataset)?
o What features seemed to be most impactful to performance?
